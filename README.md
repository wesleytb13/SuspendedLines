This is a program I wrote for work. It interfaces with a MySQL database so that I can add phone lines and a date that the phone line was suspended. It then calculates the date that the carrier will reactivate the phone line so I can check daily to see if any lines were reactivated. This is handy because they do not let me know when they do this and having this quick way to check them will allow me to resuspend them and minimize the cost of having active lines that do not need to be active. It will also let me remove lines from the database, edit/udpate the suspension date, check to see if a specific line is present in the database, and to just show all lines entered into the database along with the date they were suspended and when they will reactivate.
